All the codes and required files and dataset are attached. Go through the data_processing folder first, then continue with dataset_creation. Finally, move to Model_training folder where first execute model_creation_training.ipynb, then Embedding Extraction.ipynb followed by Finding_Similar_Books.ipynb. 

data_processing and dataset_creation can be skipped as the resources created by these files are also attached here. Fully trained model is also attached to the drive link for reference.
